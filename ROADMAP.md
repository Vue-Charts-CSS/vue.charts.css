# Ad-hoc Roadmap

ðŸ‘‰ This document extends the [Main Roadmap](https://vue-charts-css.github.io/docs/development/roadmap/).

## Additional Roadmap

+ Implement any breaking changes for Charts CSS v1.0.0, _when_ released
+ Add automated weekly dependency updates
+ Add automated tests (potentially jest) for wrapper and build deploy pipeline to NPM

> **Main note:** waiting for up-stream framework to reach v1.0.0, to validate this Vue wrapper has further merit for development.

## Pausing Vue Charts CSS development

The up-stream framework has not seen much public activity for the last 6 months and there's currently no additional
functionality to add to the wrapper. Beyond dependency updates, this wrapper won't see more development
until the up-stream framework releases an update.

## Is this dead?

**[No](https://github.com/ChartsCSS/charts.css/discussions/68)! ðŸ”¥**

However, maintaining open source projects for free is a big and admirable burden for developers.
The Charts CSS [creator](https://github.com/ramiy) has claimed the framework [is not dead](https://github.com/ChartsCSS/charts.css/discussions/68)
and will be implementing a release when time allows, with new features following [this roadmap](https://chartscss.org/development/roadmap/#roadmap).

Vue Charts CSS will promptly kickstart this roadmap once the up-stream framework sees public activity.
